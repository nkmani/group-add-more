# group-add-more
A simple jQuery plugin to simplify Drupal's add-more feature when multiple related fields are involved. 

This plugin works with Drupal 6 (and higher, hopefully, not yet tested). To make this work, the fields 
that need to be controlled should all be grouped together in a single container (preferably through field grouping).
