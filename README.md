# group-add-more
A simple jQuery plugin to simplify Drupal's add-more feature when multiple related fields are involved. 

This plugin works with Drupal 6 (branch 1.0) and 7 (branch 2.0).

To make this work, the fields that need to be controlled should all be grouped together in a single container (preferably through field grouping).

Options supported:

hide: Hide all "Add More" buttons from the individual fields. Default is false.

groupLabel: Label to use for the group add button. Default: Group Add

addMoreClass: Class name for individual add-more input. Default: field-add-more-submit

groupClass: Class name for "Group Add" button. Default: my-group-add-more
